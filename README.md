AI Lawyer - Legal Document Analysis and Question Answering

The "AI Lawyer" project is a sophisticated application designed to aid legal professionals, researchers, and curious minds in comprehending and extracting insights from legal documents. Leveraging cutting-edge natural language processing and machine learning techniques, this tool streamlines the process of navigating and extracting valuable information from legal documents, making it an invaluable asset in the legal domain.

Key Features:

Jurisdiction Selection: Users can choose their desired jurisdiction (US Law, India Law, UK Law, Pakistan Law) using an intuitive user interface.

Document Analysis: The application allows users to upload legal documents in PDF format. It then utilizes the PyPDF2 library to extract text from the PDF pages, enabling efficient analysis of the document's content.

Text Splitting: To facilitate efficient processing, the application employs the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from LangChain. This splits the extracted text into manageable chunks, ensuring smooth handling of large legal documents.

Semantic Embeddings: The project harnesses OpenAI's powerful embeddings to convert text chunks into semantically meaningful vectors. These embeddings capture the underlying meaning and context of the legal text, enhancing the accuracy of subsequent operations.

Vector Store Creation: The application employs the FAISS vector store to efficiently index and store the computed semantic embeddings. This optimizes the retrieval of relevant information during question answering.

Question Answering: Users can input legal questions in natural language. The application then performs similarity searches within the vector store to identify relevant document chunks. It subsequently utilizes OpenAI's language model to generate accurate answers based on the provided questions and retrieved document chunks.

Interactive Interface: The streamlined interface created using Streamlit offers a user-friendly experience, allowing users to interact with the AI Lawyer tool seamlessly.

How to Use:

Choose your desired jurisdiction from the provided options.
Upload the legal document you wish to analyze in PDF format.
Ask questions related to the legal content using the text input field.
