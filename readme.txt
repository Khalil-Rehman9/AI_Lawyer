AI Lawyer - Legal Document Analysis and Question Answering
The AI Lawyer project is a sophisticated application designed to aid legal professionals, researchers, and curious minds in comprehending and extracting insights from legal documents. Leveraging cutting-edge natural language processing and machine learning techniques, this tool streamlines the process of navigating and extracting valuable information from legal documents, making it an invaluable asset in the legal domain.

Key Features
Jurisdiction Selection: Choose your desired jurisdiction (US Law, India Law, UK Law, Pakistan Law) using an intuitive user interface.

Document Analysis: Upload legal documents in PDF format. The application uses the PyPDF2 library to extract text from PDF pages, enabling efficient analysis of the document's content.

Text Splitting: Utilize the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from LangChain to split extracted text into manageable chunks, ensuring smooth handling of large legal documents.

Semantic Embeddings: Leverage OpenAI's embeddings to convert text chunks into semantically meaningful vectors. These embeddings capture underlying meaning and context, enhancing accuracy for subsequent operations.

Vector Store Creation: Employ the FAISS vector store to efficiently index and store computed semantic embeddings. This optimizes retrieval of relevant information during question answering.

Question Answering: Input legal questions in natural language. The application performs similarity searches within the vector store to identify relevant document chunks. It then uses OpenAI's language model to generate accurate answers based on questions and retrieved document chunks.

Interactive Interface: Enjoy a user-friendly experience with the streamlined interface created using Streamlit. Interact seamlessly with the AI Lawyer tool.
